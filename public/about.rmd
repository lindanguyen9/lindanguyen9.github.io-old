I'm currently a doctoral student at UT Dallas studying Cognition and Neuroscience. When I'm not in school, you can find me at a local Dallas yoga studio taking class (or teaching it!), flying in the air on silks or lyra, or capturing moments through photography. You can also find me trying out new locally-owned coffee shops or having brunch with my friends. You can follow my adventures on Instagram @linda_nguyennn and @lindadoesyoga.
